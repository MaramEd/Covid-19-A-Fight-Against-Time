## Project Contributors: 
Khalid Alharthi, Malak bin Obaid, Maram Edrees, Sara Alsoghayer, Sarah Alghamdi.

## Project Summary/Scope:
COVID-19 is “a newly discovered coronavirus that infects humans and whose [rapid] spread has [led] to a global pandemic with zero available therapeutic strategies” (Mamoor, 2020, p. 5). Thus, the project’s objective is to explore how the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread around the world in such a short time and try to predict how it will continue to spread in order to provide insights to help combat the disease.

## Project Main Features:
The CRross Industry Standard Process (CRISP) framework was implemented to carry out all the steps involved in this project:
- In the first stage, the problem statement was identified and described. 
- In the second stage, the COVID-19 data that can provide a solution to the problem was sought, collected and preprocessed. 
- In the third stage, the COVID-19 data was explored and examined further in preparation for modeling. 
- In the fourth stage, the data was modeled using ARIMA and LSTM time series models. 
 -In the fifth stage, the results of the model were evaluated and used to forecast the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.
